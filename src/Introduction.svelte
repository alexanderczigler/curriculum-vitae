  <h3>Hello!</h3>
  <p>
    We are at the golden age of team efficiency. I firmly believe that companies
    who want to thrive in the future need to make their employees experts at
    cooperation and autonomy.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where I come in; I love using my technical experience to help
    improve the culture and way of working. My specialty is meshing into
    existing teams and taking a blended role helping out where I am needed most
    from day to day; be it pair-programming, agile coaching or UX research.
  </p>
  <p>
    My long background as a system developer has given me a lot of insights as
    to why so many IT projects fail. I am a great addition to any team that
    wants to identify bottlenecks, have fun and learn the ways of DevOps
    Thinking and Lean UX.
