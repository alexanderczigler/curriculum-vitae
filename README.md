# My curriculum-vitae

We are at the golden age of team efficiency. I believe that companies focusing on making their employees experts at cooperation and autonomy are the companies that will thrive in the future.

This is where I come in. I love helping companies improve their culture and way of working. My specialty is meshing into existing teams and taking the role of someone who does anything from pair-programming to agile coaching.

My long background as a system developer has given me a lot of insights as to why so many IT projects fail. I can be a great addition to any team that wants to learn the ways of DevOps Thinking and Lean UX.

## Experience

### Code, Devops and NoEstimates mentor at Iteam Solutions

*Feb 2013 - -*

At Iteam I have been on a constant journey filled with varying projects and experiences. I started off in 2013 doing backend development in .NET. During the years I have slowly progressed onto learning node.js, devops (aws, opsworks, docker) and getting deeper into linux as well as the fun art of mentoring other developers. 

The mentoring part is the most rewarding and enjoyable thing I have ever done. I have a burning passion for lean development and devops and I love teaching others about the benefits of those two aspects.

In every project at Iteam we strive to form a close, functional team together with key people from our customer's organisation. This enables us to work together unhindered and produce as much value as possible for the customer.

Methods: MVP, lean, kanban, no-estimates
System development; Node.JS, .NET, dotnet core
Release pipeline && DevOps; AWS, azure, digital ocean, docker, linux

#### DevOps and Agile mentoring at SEB (Iteam consultant)

*Apr 2017 - Jan 2019*

At SEB I worked alongside some of SEB's developers helping them implement new methodologies as well as container technology using Docker, Docker Swarm, OpenShift and dotnet core.

I acted as both a technical mentor and an agile coach. I did pair-programming with developers as well as giving middle and high level managers new insights into what SEB should do differently.

#### Tech lead, DevOps engineer at Vimla (Iteam consultant)

*Jan 2014 - Jan 2018*

I began working with Vimla when they were still sketching the ideas for what would be a very successful fighter brand. The journey from the first to way over 100 000 subscribers was very exciting and taught me a lot.

I added a lot of technical competence to the team, building, rebuilding and maintaining their public web, public API and other tools used by both subscribers and the Vimla staff themselves.

#### Developer at TV4-Gruppen (Mogul consultant)

*Aug 2010 - Feb 2013*

During my time at Mogul I worked as a consultant at TV4 Gruppen where I was responsible for development and maintenance of their CRM and sales support system. The system handles the sales of most of TV4's advertising and is thus responsible for the bulk of their yearly income.

The technical solution was very complex, spanning over ten years of dotnet technologies ranging from traditional ASP to dotnet 4, sql server and a handful of different types of automatic integrations to other systems.

Apart from coding and building the system I was also responsible for onboarding new developers to the team every now and then and mentoring them until they became self sufficient.

Worked close with customer's ERP teams, defining current and future needs in their organisations.

## Volunteer Experience

### Refugee Tech

*Feb 2016 - Dec 2017*

Starting at a hackathon that Refugee Tech held me and a few coworkers created *Competency*. The idea of the project is to map the competencies of refugees on their way to or already living in Sweden. 

The data is meant to be used to show meda, politicians and the Swedish population that refugees have a lot of competence and talent that Sweden should utilize. In conjunction with a job search engine it can also be used to match individuals with available jobs and employers looking for talent.

Thanks to the efforts of me and the team, Competency later evolved into JobSkills - jobskills.se
